 ## Words
 Some advanced information about the words:
 
 * The words will be placed **randomly** in multiple orientations and depending on the selected difficulty they can get more complicated.
 * The initial instruction is maintained, to capture the words you need to select all and only their letters at once in a straight line.
 * Let's keep things simple! The words do not intersect.
 * To deserve the **cookies rain** üç™, you need to capture **all the words**.
