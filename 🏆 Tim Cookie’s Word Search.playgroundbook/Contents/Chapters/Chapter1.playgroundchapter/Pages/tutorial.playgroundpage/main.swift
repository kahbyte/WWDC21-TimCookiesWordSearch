 # Introduction
 
 Tim Cookie's Word Search is a [word search](glossary://wordsearch) book! 🔍
 
 Your goal is to find all the words intentionally placed on the grid, as a reward it will **rain cookies**! 🍪
 
 # First Steps
 
 To capture a word, you need to slide the mouse over it at once.
 
 Try selecting the word **Apple** on the screen! 🍎
 
 Once you are approved in this task, come see me in the [next page](@next).
